                        Conceptualized and proposed a unique platform idea for Vtuber enthusiasts that goes beyond text-based interactions by allowing creators to invite their fans to co-stream. Additionally, envisioned a cutting-edge platform offering creative freedom to Vtubers, leveraging the diverse capabilities of the Web3 industry and partnering with a prominent adult industry company in Mandarin-speaking regions.

                        I excel in user research and flowchart design, complemented by strong communication skills that facilitate effective collaboration with project planners and back-end engineers. When we encounter project challenges, I initiate discussions with project planners to formulate solutions and then engage with the back-end engineers to address API-related considerations. Our team's exceptional synergy consistently keeps us on the right course. To bridge the gap when front-end engineers are unavailable, I take on the responsibility of both designing and coding prototypes using Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and JS.

                        Distinguished early adopters and identified unique value propositions through collaboration with operations departments.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rationale behind this initiative stems from several key observations. Twitter and Youtube have imposed restrictions on creators due to adult content policies, while the prominent adult stream platform, Chaturbate, lacks a dedicated space for Vtuber creators. Moreover, the search trend on Pornhub indicates a surge in interest in "Hentai," ranking as the top category in 2022. Lastly, our position as an NFT sector within the adult industry provides us with valuable resources.
                        <br>
                        As a result of these insights, we made the strategic decision to develop <span id="vtuber_part05">an unrestricted streaming platform</span> that caters to both Vtuber creators and adult content enthusiasts.

                        Recognized the significance of physiological needs and self-actualization in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs within the context of our platform.
                        <br>
                        Our website revolves around three core concepts: "Enter the stream," "Find their favorite vtubers," and "Discover different streamers." To ensure efficiency akin to popular adult websites like Pornhub, as well as fostering creator-viewer interactions similar to Twitch and Chaturbate, I meticulously crafted user flows. This approach streamlines the user experience, allowing them to reach their goals seamlessly.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, our streaming page was designed to enable intuitive invitations and access for both streamers and viewers.
                        <br>
                        Collaborated with the project planner team to research the Blue Ocean strategy, systematically evaluating our unique advantages in comparison to competitors. This effort ensures that our MVP occupies a strategically advantageous position in the market.

                </span>
                <p>
                    Our vision entails crafting a unique 3D environment where Vtuber models seamlessly come to life on the screen, allowing guests to navigate within the space. Despite numerous iterations, I aimed to break away from conventional designs that closely resembled other web browsers. It was a chance encounter with MMO RPG game UIs that sparked the inspiration for our ultimate solution—a full-screen streaming UI for browsers. This innovative interface empowers users to toggle function boxes on and off and customize their layout by arranging these function boxes as they see fit.

                    I designed the prototype using XD, HTML, CSS, and JS, collaborating with back-end engineers to develop the MVP for functional testing. The testing phase involved approximately 100 team members at our Taipei-based company. Our primary objective was to facilitate user interactions with Vtubers, achieved through the following key features:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>
                            Enabled 100 users to access streams using their cryptocurrency wallet addresses.</li>
                        <li>
                            Offered customizable function box placements for user comfort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implemented a chat bar for seamless communication.

                        <li>
                            Enabled user donations to streamers.

                        <li>
                            Facilitated user entry into streams through streamer invitations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    This project's inspiration stems from several observations. Twitter and Youtube have implemented restrictions on content creators due to adult content policies. Additionally, Chaturbate, a prominent adult streaming platform, lacks a dedicated space for Vtuber creators. Furthermore, the search trend on Pornhub for "Hentai" surged to the top position in 2022. Leveraging our NFT expertise within the adult industry, we decided to create an unrestricted streaming platform catering to both Vtuber creators and adult content enthusiasts.

                        97% successfully reach the goal, and 93% of users have great experiences with this product. 5% for good experiences, and 2% think it was a lousy product. The bad experience users feedbacked the issue of the cryptocurrency wallet connecting. They needed help finding the place to sign in the wallet address to join the streamers' invitations. So I move the link button to where the users only need two steps to reach the goal.
